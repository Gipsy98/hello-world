Hi everyone!
I'm here to learn about ruby and ruby on rails.
I love dogs, cats and flowers.
I spend my end-weekends reading things about the universe.
I don't write and speak well in english because I'm lazy and I do not study
to improve my english. 
I'm brasilian, I speak well portuguese and spanish, I understand french musics sometimes... And sometimes I speak well french too. SOMETIMES. The same thing happens with english: sometimes I know, sometimes I do not.
I hope to have focus and get to learn Ruby. I hope to have focus and get to finish any goal in my life.
I'm tired of procrastinating. 
P.s: You can correct the sentences / words that I wrote wrong. (Helping me to be less dumb) THANKS!
